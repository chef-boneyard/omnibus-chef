  # The way we install chef is different between chefdk and chef projects
  # due to the fact that chefdk project has appbundler enabled.
  # Two differences are:
  #   1-) Order of bundle install & rake gem
  #   2-) "-n #{install_dir}/bin" option for gem install
  # We don't expect any side effects from (1) other than not creating
  # link to erubis binary (which is not needed other than ruby 1.8.7 due to
  # change that switched the template syntax checking to native ruby code.
  # Not having (2) does not create symlinks for binaries under
  # #{install_dir}/bin which gets created by appbundler later on.
